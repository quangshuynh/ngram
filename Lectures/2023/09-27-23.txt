- Each symbol in a sequence has a position, or index, starting from 0
	- Negative indexes are allowed

- Slices have a start, an end index and step
	- s(2, 5, 1)

- If the start or end index is missing, Python uses default values
	- Default start = beginning of string
	- Default end = end of string
	- Default step = +1

- Strings are immutable. Any index access or slice operation creates a copy

- String Concatenation
	- Two or more strings can be joined using concatenation
	- Only strings can be concatenated
	
- ASCII
	- "A" to "Z" go from 65-90
	- "a" to "z" go from 97-122
	- ord() to get ASCII value of symbol 
		- ord("a") = 65
	- chr() to get symbol of an ASCII
		- chr(65) = "A"

- Complexity
	- Accessing a character in a string with an index takes constant time, or fixed time
	- Linear time is more expensive than fixed time

- Files
	- open() returns file object
		- f = open("myfile.txt")
	- Have to use forward slash when navigating through file directory
	- Always close file when done
		- f.close()
	- Reading a file takes time proportional to the number of lines in the file (linear)
	- with - as files automatically close file
		- with open(boop) as file:


1. s[:3] + s[4:]
	
2. s = "staple"  
for ch in s:  
    if ch != "p":  
        print(ch, end="")
	
3. s = "staple"  
for ch in range(0, len(s)):  
    if ch != 3:  
        print(s[ch], end="")
	  
4. Linear
	
5. s[::2]

6. The function didn't open or close the file

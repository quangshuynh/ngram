Week 3 quiz password: BaseCaseRecurse

- Main guard
	- Can run a module directly as a main program or can import the way we import the turtle.
		- if \__name\__ == '\__main\__'
- Recursive function
	- A function that calls itself
	- Can be more efficient
	- How to know when to stop working
		- When the variable is equal to the finished value
			- Translating an algorithm or formula directly into a recursive function without changing it is called a:
				- Na√Øve implementation

	- Base case uses a Boolean condition to decide whether or not it is time to stop working
		- Condition to stop the recursion
	- Recursive case does one unit of work
	- Prepares for next step

- Stack frames
	- Each time one function calls another, a new stack frame is added to the memory
	- A collection of stack frames is called a "call stack"
	- The oldest stack frame is on the bottom
	- The newest stack frame is on the top

- Recursion depth
	- The number of times a recursion function call is made before reaching the base case
	- The Python default limit to the number of stack frames is 1000
		- Exceeding this amount will result in a recursion error
			- Known as "blowing up the stack"

- Substitution trace
	- A good way to understand how a recursive function operates is to trace the iterations
	- Expanding and writing out the recursion in the function

- Fibonacci

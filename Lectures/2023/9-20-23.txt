- A continue statement inside a loop skips all remaining statements in the loop and goes back to the enclosing while loop statement

1. def draw_squares_iter(sides):
		sides = 4
		while sides > 0:
			turtle.forward(100)
			turtle.left(90)
			sides = side - 1


- Perform a substitution trace for bunnies pop rec(10, 3): 
 bunnies_pop_rec(10, 3) = bunnies_pop_rec(50, 2)
= bunnies_pop_rec(250, 1)
= bunnies_pop_rec(1250, 0)
= 1250
